# Project Description

This is the repository for the PSYC575 Class Project dealing with the effect of birth experience and delivery method on parental stress. We use time series data of over 100 couples with at least at least 3 measures in 3, and 6 month intervals. The data is nested in participants (mother/father) which are again nested in couples, resulting in a three level hierarchichal data structure.

We use a multi-level model using the lme4 package in r to model parental stress over birth experience and birth delivery method and account for N covariates (X, Y, Z).
