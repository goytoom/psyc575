# Background
Do stressful birthing experiences and delivery method (i.e., cesarean vs. vaginal delivery) predict postpartum parenting stress in first-time mothers and fathers? Prior research (Sellery et al., poster, 2021) has shown that stressful birthing experiences significantly predict paternal postpartum depression. However, this research did not include a multilevel model and did not take into account mothersâ€™ experiences or predict maternal stress/depression.

# Data Structure
The data used in this project come from the NEST lab's Hormones Across the Transition to Childrearing (HATCH) study, a longitudinal parenting dataset. The data is nested within couples and persons Each couple has one male and one female partner, and each partner was tested during the prenatal and perinatal (birth) periods, as well as at three time points during the postpartum period (3, 6, and 12 months' postpartum).

The current study will focus specifically on the three postpartum time points, using data from the prenatal and perinatal periods only as level-2 and level-3 covariates.

# Statistical Analyses
## Hypothesis 
Parenting stress at 3-12 months' postpartum is predicted by negative birthing experiences (BEQ) and delivery method. 

## Proposed Analyses
Parenting stress ~ time + birth experience + delivery method*birth experience 

### Variables
- **Level 1 Outcome**: Parenting stress (PSI)
- **Level 1 Predictor**: time (3, 6, 12 months)
- **Level 2 Predictor**: subjective Birth Experience (BEQ)
- **Level 3 Predictors**: Delivery Method, couples' mean birth experience (BEQ_cm)
- **Covariates**:  
        - Gender (person)  
        - Age (person)  
        - Health conditions (person)  
        - Gestational age (couple)  
        - Baby sex (couple)
